rennaissance-receipt-parser
===========================

A NodeJS app to make submitting hotel expenses slightly easier. Food is covered under a per-diem, but if you eat at the hotel, it shows up on the receipt. Run the HTML of the receipt the Rennaissance sends you through this, and it will tell you how much to actually expense.
